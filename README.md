## About Me
In 2016, I graduated from McMaster University with a civil engineering degree and began a career in the telecommunications industry. However, after several years in this field, I came to the realization this is not the lifelong path I envisioned. Feeling a bit lost and unsure about which direction
to take my career, I took my friend's advice and picked up programming. And this was the beginning of my journey to become a software developer. I took the leap of faith and quit my engineering job to learn programming full-time on my own. The journey was hard and long but within 16 months I was able to land my first full stack developer gig.

## What gives me energy at work
- Being assigned tasks that are difficult and challenging but not out of my pay grade. These types of projects always excite me because I love a challenge. Nothing feels better than being able to overcome a hard problem.
- Collaborating with other team members. As someone who enjoys social interactions, pair programming is one of my favourite ways to work with my peers. It keeps me engaged and builds a sense of camaraderie as we accomplish goals together as a team.

## What drains my energy
- Attending meetings where I am mostly a fly on the wall and don't have much valuable input to share.

## Preferred communication channels/style
I find a variety of communication styles effective, however, I lean towards direct and open communication. When we're working in person, feel free to approach me, and I'd be glad to assist. At Harled, we leverage Gather to simulate an in-person workspace, so consider it similar to a casual office interaction when you approach my avatar there. I also find Slack convenient if you'd like to connect with me there. Email tends to have much slower response times, so it's my least preferred communication channel.
