## About Me
In 2016, I graduated from McMaster University with a civil engineering degree and began a career in the telecommunications industry. However, after several years in this field, I came to the realization this is not the lifelong path I envisioned. Feeling a bit lost and unsure about which direction
to take my career, I took my friend's advice and picked up programming. And this was the beginning of my journey to become a software developer. I took the leap of faith and quit my engineering job to learn programming full-time on my own. The journey was hard and long but within 16 months I was able to land my first full stack developer gig.

## What gives me energy at work
- Being assigned tasks that are difficult and challenging but not out of my paygrade. These types of project always excites me because I love a challenge. 
Nothing feels better than being able to overcome a hard problem.
- Collaborating with other team members. As someone who enjoys social interactions, I love activities such as pair programming. 
It keeps me engaged and builds a sense of comradery when we accomplish our goal.

## What drains my energy
- Attending meetings that I am mostly a fly on the wall and don't have much input.

## Preferred communication channels/style
Honestly, I don't really have a preference of communcation style. If we are working in person, feel free to just walk up to me, I will be happy to help you. At Harled, we use Gather to mimic an in-person workplace. If I am on Gather, treat it like we are in the office and just walk up to my avatar.
You can also message me on Slack if that is your preferred method of communcation. My least favourite source of communcation is e-mail as response time
are generally a lot slower.
